# Nimai's personal website

This is my static blog generated using a modified version of the amazing
[makesite ](http://github.com/sunainapai/makesite) python script. The website
currently uses zero Javascript and that is how I plan on keeping it.

## Build

The website can be built by running `make site`. The original Makefile had a
`serve` target to host the static site in `_site/` using a python server. 

The `livereload` script can be used to edit the blog's markdown files and see
the website content change in real-time.
